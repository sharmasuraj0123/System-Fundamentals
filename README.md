Here is the list of all the Projects that were done in my Systems Fundamentals (CSE 320) course.
All the projects are in C compiled on x-86 linux machine.
I constantly keep on updating the code sometimes to make it more efficient or add more functionality to it.

HW0 - It is just a basic homework to get used to C, git and the linux environment.

HW1 Substitution Cipher & Tutnese Encryption.

•	Created an Susbstution Cipher and Tutnese description using just pointer arithmetic. The entire purpose of this assignment was to get aqauinted
to pointers in C.

HW2 - Spell Checker.

•	A parser that will fix all the mispelled words and return the text with correct spellings. 
•	Created a dictionary that will store all the words and 5 possible misspellings.


HW3 Dynamic Memory Allocator.

•	Implemented a dynamic memory allocator (malloc, free and realloc), utilizing the concepts of coalescing and explicit free list. 


HW4 Shell

•	Implemented a bash-like shell that supports job control, I/O redirection and basic shell features using signal handling, file descriptors, etc.
•	Shell used multi-process approach to handle piping and job control requests


HW5 Group Chat Application (Multi-threaded Server).

•	Implemented a group chat server in C, where all the logged in users can chat.
•	The server used the multi-threaded approach, where multiple users can login, send and receive messages in linear time.


Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns regarding any of these topics.

Thank you.
